				<h3>The Project</h3>
				<p>
      	Pigi Performing analysis on a software repository is an important step in retrieving information about the evolution of a piece of software and retrieving the correct information for performing maintenance on it. Performing this analysis is, however, an intensive task. The amount of information for a single repository can be large, all the files and revisions; this would be even larger if multiple repositories are analyzed.

				<h3>Software analysis</h3>
				<p>
	      A software repository is a means to keep track of and store changes during the evolution of a software product. The repository stores different versions of the same software project. Performing analysis on each of these different versions can be used to see a time-lapse of the software evolving. The proposed system will be able to show this evolution of the software; specifically, it will show the evolution of complexity of the software stored in a repository. The focus lies on analyzing and presenting available information using modern web and cloud technologies
